# SmashApp

SmashApp created by the GarlicKnights, otherwise known as Aaron Bone, Jaylon Kiper, and Elizabeth Fultz, is a prototype application created to service Super Smash Brothers tournaments. At full functionality, the application would allow tournament organizers to record things such as stage and character choice as well as an individual players win ration overall. It would also allow players to find local tournaments and other local players through a not yet developed, social media like platform that would provide a way for the Smash community to have a hub for discussions on character choice, stages, and tournaments.      

### Software Engineering Assignment #1

   This first assignment that was done for this project was designing a package for the product as if it were to be physically sold in stores. The first step in the process was determining what the product would be, the name of the product, possible users, and possible features. All the documentation for this stage of this assignment can be found in the GarlicKnightSmashApp.pdf document located in the design_documents folder. The next step was to create the box and then present it in our Software Design and Development class. Photos of the mock packaging can also be found in the design_documents folder.  

### Software Engineering Assignment #2

   The second assignment of this project entailed conducting interviews of potential users, developing feature diagrams, personas, scenarios, user stories, and a feature list for the product so that we could plan what the product would be able to do based on the response we received from the potential users. The documentation for this assignment can be found in the design_documents folder under the file name GarlicKnightsFeatureList.pdf.

### Software Engineering Assignment #3
   
Assignment 3 had the goal of developing the architecture for the product by determining how the product should be organized, how components should communicate, and what technologies should be used when building the system. This step in the process formed the base of the protype that was created in the next step. The documentation for this project is stored under architectural_design_GarlicKnights.pdf in the design_Documents folder.  

### Software Engineering Assignment #4
   
The last and final part of this project was the prototype itself. By far the most time intensive and complex assignment, we developed a basic prototype of the app we were looking to create with some basic functionality. After the coding of the prototype, we created some unit test to ensure the application would run as intended and attempted to containerize the product with Docker. 

### Docker Instructions:

At this time we were not able to get the Docker Container in working order. 

### Docker Link:

### Running Unit Tests:

With running the unit tests for SmashApp, we tested two features prevelant in the application. This includes testing the Set class for making sure the input and selections are running the right way for the Match Reporting function. Then there is the tests for the Player class to see if input and selection is correct for the User Function.

### Project Reflection:

This project, while incredibly difficult to do while juggling other classes and responsibilities, did teach us a lot about the design and implementation process of a software product. Especially now that we are at the end of the road in terms of developing this product for class, it is very apparent that a good foundation and product vision is necessary for the product to work out. The first assignment, while the easiest to complete, was also one of the most important as it developed a good foundation for our future work. Though the product vision we created could use some improvements, it did help us make Aaronâ€™s idea for a Super Smash Brothers related application more concrete and viable. The process of jotting down potential people interested in our product and the features also assisted in making the idea seem like something that we could do rather than a though floating around. 
    
Another important part of this project was the creation of the user stories based on the interviews that were done by Jaylon and Aaron. Through this we were able to get some concrete feedback on the product idea from those that might be interested in using it in the future. When interviewing those potential users, Jaylon interviewed people who would not really have time set up tournaments or attend them for Smash Bros. but were interested in the idea for various reasons. Aaron's interviews included attendees from his Smash Club, and they seemed ecstatic about the idea. These interviews, which then became personas and user stories, helped guide us on what people actually might want to see from a product of this type. It was at this point that we went back to review out feature list and put what was learned and suggested in the interviews into the plan for the final product. 
    
On the last stretch of this project, there were a lot of issues with producing our prototype. Mostly, this involved scheduling issues, even throughout the semester, and working alongside different group projects in different classes. We most likely could've done better, but that seemed like an impossibility at the time with everything going on. One of the biggest things that this project taught us is that while learning everything in a classroom is certainly useful, it is also extremely important to get hands on experience with the development process for products and applications, especially since so much goes into them. This experience has taught us as a group the importance of clear communication and scheduling when it comes to an assignment of this magnitude.
