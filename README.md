# SmashApp

## SmashApp created by the GarlicKnights, otherwise known as Aaron Bone, Jaylon Kiper, and Elizabeth Fultz, is a prototype application created to service Super Smash Brothers tournaments. At full functionality, the application would allow tournament organizers to record things such as stage and character choice as well as an individual players win ration overall. It would also allow players to find local tournaments and other local players through a not yet developed, social media like platform that would provide a way for the Smash community to have a hub for discussions on character choice, stages, and tournaments.      

Software Engineering Assignment #1
   : This first assignment that was done for this project was designing a package for the product as if it were to be physically sold in stores. The first step in the process was determining what the product would be, the name of the product, possible users, and possible features. All the documentation for this stage of this assignment can be found in the GarlicKnightSmashApp.pdf document located in the design_documents folder. The next step was to create the box and then present it in our Software Design and Development class. Photos of the mock packaging can also be found in the design_documents folder.  

Software Engineering Assignment #2
       : The second assignment of this project entailed conducting interviews of potential users, developing feature diagrams, personas, scenarios, user stories, and a feature list for the product so that we could plan what the product would be able to do based on the response we received from the potential users. The documentation for this assignment can be found in the design_documents folder under the file name GarlicKnightsFeatureList.pdf.

Software Engineering Assignment #3
    : Assignment 3 had the goal of developing the architecture for the product by determining how the product should be organized, how components should communicate, and what technologies should be used when building the system. This step in the process formed the base of the protype that was created in the next step. The documentation for this project is stored under architectural_design_GarlicKnights.pdf in the design_Documents folder.  

Software Engineering Assignment #4
    : The last and final part of this project was the prototype itself. By far the most time intensive and complex assignment, we developed a basic prototype of the app we were looking to create with some basic functionality. After the coding of the prototype, we created some unit test to ensure the application would run as intended and attempted to containerize the product with Docker.
