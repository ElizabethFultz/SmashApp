# SmashApp

SmashApp created by the GarlicKnights, otherwise known as Aaron Bone, Jaylon Kiper, and Elizabeth Fultz, is a prototype application created to service Super Smash Brothers tournaments. At full functionality, the application would allow tournament organizers to record things such as stage and character choice as well as an individual players win ration overall. It would also allow players to find local tournaments and other local players through a not yet developed, social media like platform that would provide a way for the Smash community to have a hub for discussions on character choice, stages, and tournaments.      

### Software Engineering Assignment #1

   This first assignment that was done for this project was designing a package for the product as if it were to be physically sold in stores. The first step in the process was determining what the product would be, the name of the product, possible users, and possible features. All the documentation for this stage of this assignment can be found in the GarlicKnightSmashApp.pdf document located in the design_documents folder. The next step was to create the box and then present it in our Software Design and Development class. Photos of the mock packaging can also be found in the design_documents folder.  

### Software Engineering Assignment #2

   The second assignment of this project entailed conducting interviews of potential users, developing feature diagrams, personas, scenarios, user stories, and a feature list for the product so that we could plan what the product would be able to do based on the response we received from the potential users. The documentation for this assignment can be found in the design_documents folder under the file name GarlicKnightsFeatureList.pdf.

### Software Engineering Assignment #3
   
Assignment 3 had the goal of developing the architecture for the product by determining how the product should be organized, how components should communicate, and what technologies should be used when building the system. This step in the process formed the base of the protype that was created in the next step. The documentation for this project is stored under architectural_design_GarlicKnights.pdf in the design_Documents folder.  

### Software Engineering Assignment #4
   
The last and final part of this project was the prototype itself. By far the most time intensive and complex assignment, we developed a basic prototype of the app we were looking to create with some basic functionality. After the coding of the prototype, we created some unit test to ensure the application would run as intended and attempted to containerize the product with Docker. 

### Docker Instructions:

### Docker Link:
https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/elizabethfultz/smashapp

### Running Unit Tests:

   With running the unit tests for SmashApp, we tested two features prevelant in the application. This includes testing the Set class for making sure the input and slections are running the right way for the Match Reporting function. Then there is the tests for the Player class to see if input and selection is correct for the User Function.

### Project Reflection:

   Part 1:
    At the beginning of this group project, trying to find an idea for the overall class felt difficult at first. Aaron, however, crafted a great idea to create an application for Super Smash players to use and record tournament information. Teh process of jotting down potential people interested in our product and the features was not a difficult task. I think our product vision was good, but could be improved on in the future. Cretaing the box was relatively simple since Elizabeth had skills in arts and crafts. our presentation went pretty well as we covered the basics on what SmashApp was all about. It was off the top of our heads too, since we didn't really prep a speech for everybody.
    
   Part 2:
    When interviewing potential users of SmashApp, on Jaylon's end, he interviewed most people with no time to set up tournaments or attend them for Smash Bros., but interested overall about the idea. Aaron's interviews included attendees from his Smash Club and they seemed estatic about the idea. Our feature diagrams on possible function s were very suitable with what our group wanted to create. Also, the descriptions of personas, scenarios, user stories, and a proper feature list were very basic, but our video definetely gave more confidence on our projects backing. 
    
   Part 3:
    For our architectual design, we took most of the ideas on our data sources being CSV files that would be transformed into the database rows. This would be represented in a GUI format and allowed automatic updates in the system for all players. This overall lays out the products organization, distribution, and what tech is involved in building our system.
    
   Part 4:
   On the last stretch of this project, there were alot of issues with producing our prototype. Mostly, this involved scheduling issues, even throughout the semester, and working alongside different group projects in different classes. I think we could've donee better with more time, but that seemed like an immpossibility at the time.
